        Throughout high school and into college I have worked many jobs. I worked as a carpenter with a construction company, I worked as a babysitter for my neighbors and lastly and most recently, I have worked at a supermarket in the deli section working with cutting meats and cheeses. Each of these jobs have taught me something important each time and I will cherish those memories as I move on in my professional life.
As a carpenter, having to experience physical labor for the first time as a job, I found it very difficult at first and felt myself becoming worn out very quickly. I won't try to hide from the truth, I found myself wanting to quit a few times but whether it was my dad who kept encouraging me to continue or my ambition to continue what I set out to do, I kept on with it. By the end of the summer when I had to leave due to school, I realized that I gained very important insight onto multiple things. I found that a lot of things in life won't be so easy and that you need to constantly push forth effort and even tire yourself out in the process to be able to achieve great things. It sounds cliche but it is true. I felt disciplined by the end of the experience and I found myself feeling more accomplished than I would have been if I had quit.
As a babysitter for my neighbors, I found myself being able to handle kids with ease. From receiving tips and tricks from my mother who is a teacher for preschoolers, I was able to take care and be responsible when dealt with the tasks required for a babysitter. Whether it was remembering to make lunch or put them to bed, I was able to complete them easily. During this time in my life, I felt accomplished that I could handle anything that goes my way. Obviously, this was not the case as this was before my carpenting job and before physical labor was introduced to me. However, this job allowed me to be more confident in myself when things were thrown at me.
Lastly, and most recently, my job at my local grocery store once again reminded me of how hard the real world can be at times especially in jobs similar to that of a deli worker. Some days were easy some were difficult but every day I was cutting meat. Jokes aside, I realized that things are not always as easy as they seem. Before coming into the job I felt as if it was going to be a walk in the park but after being the guy responsible, alone even at times, to take orders left and right from customers, I was reminded how difficult things are. From the first day, my eyes were opened and I became more aware that if I want to stay at this job and do my part well, I need to put forth a lot more effort including memorization and a happy personality for the customers.
